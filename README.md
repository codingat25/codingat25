- 👋 Hi, I’m Christian Jay Q. Reyes, living in the Philippines and currently working in Department of Education. 
- 👀 I’m interested in computers and basketball.

  🌱 After having enough knowledge about HTML, CSS, and Javascript, I decided to learn Vue JS and Tailwind CSS. 
  For now, I haven't started creating my personal projects but with the phase that I'm currently in, I might be able to  do simple 
  web applications to help people in my current work. These will help a lot of teaching and non-teaching personnel in all municipalities in our province.
  I will also post these projects in my portfolio to help me with my employment and reach that tech job that I'm dreaming about.
  💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that involves Vue 3 and Tailwind CSS
